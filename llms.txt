# crabpack

This R package generates the standard design-based indices of catch per
unit effort, abundance, and biomass from NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science
Center RACE Eastern Bering Sea Shelf (from 1975) and Northern Bering Sea
Shelf (from 2010) bottom trawl survey data.

*This package and documentation is still under development, please
submit an issue if you come across a bug.*  
 

## Installation
